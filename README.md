# 3D-Maze
This is for my CSCI Artificial Intelligence course at USC. Using Python, I programmed a system that is able to take in inputs of 3D mapping points and find the optimal solution to its goal point. This code uses basic Artificial Intelligence concepts like BFS, UCS, and A* search. In my code, I implemented all 3 searches and I mainly used queues or in python, dequeues. I avoided using lists in python, and used sets to speed up the running time. The time complexity should be optimal as large data sets only take a few seconds. The solution is guaranteed the optimal path given proper actions and inputs. The code will not work unless you change the name of the input file to "input.txt"
